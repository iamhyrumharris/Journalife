# Research Directory

This directory contains research files from Claude Code sub-agent analysis work.

## Directory Structure

### `/completed/`
Research and analysis that has been successfully implemented:
- ✅ **Single-User Conversion** (Aug 18, 2025) - Complete removal of multi-user infrastructure

### `/in_progress/`
Research for features currently being worked on:
- *Empty - no active research projects*

### `/planned/`
Research for future features and improvements:
- *Available for future research projects*

## Usage Workflow

### 📋 Research Phase
Sub-agents should:
1. **Create research files** in `/planned/` or `/in_progress/` based on project status
2. **Follow naming convention**: `[category]_[feature_name]_analysis.md`
3. **Use appropriate sub-agent templates** for research structure
4. **Save detailed implementation plans** before main agent starts coding

### 🔄 Implementation Phase  
Main agent should:
1. **Read all relevant research files** before starting implementation
2. **Move files to `/in_progress/`** when implementation begins
3. **Reference research plans** throughout implementation
4. **Note any deviations** from original research during implementation

### ✅ Completion Phase
Upon feature completion, ALWAYS:
1. **Move research files to `/completed/`**
2. **Create completion summary** using template at `.claude/templates/completion_checklist.md`
3. **Document implementation vs. research** - what matched, what changed, why
4. **Capture lessons learned** for future similar projects
5. **Reference completed research** for patterns in future work

### 🎯 Completion Summary Requirements
Each completed feature should have:
- **Completion summary file**: `[feature_name]_completion_summary.md`
- **Use completion template**: Reference `.claude/templates/completion_checklist.md`
- **Metrics and impact**: Code changes, performance, architecture impact
- **Lessons learned**: What worked, what could be improved
- **Patterns established**: New architectural patterns for future reference

### 📝 Templates Available
- **Completion Checklist**: `.claude/templates/completion_checklist.md` - Comprehensive completion workflow
- **Sub-agent Research**: Each sub-agent file contains research templates

## Current Status

**Last Major Project**: Single-User Conversion (Aug 18, 2025)
- All multi-user infrastructure successfully removed
- Architecture simplified for single-user focus
- Project archived in `/completed/` directory
