# WebDAV Sync Debug Checklist

## Current Issue
Your logs show: **"Starting upload of 0 items..."** 

This means the WebDAV sync service is working correctly, but no journals are configured for sync.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Configure Journals for Sync
1. Open the app
2. Go to **Settings** → **Journal Settings** → **Sync Management**
3. Find your WebDAV configuration: "iamhyrumharris@gmail.com_data"
4. **Enable/Select the journals** you want to sync
5. Save the configuration

### 2. What to Look For
- **Before Fix**: `syncedJournalIds: []` (empty list)
- **After Fix**: `syncedJournalIds: [journal-id-1, journal-id-2]` (with actual journal IDs)

### 3. Verify the Fix
After configuring journals for sync:
1. Run sync again
2. Look for these log messages:
   - `Found X journals to sync: [Journal Names]`
   - `Starting upload of X items...` (where X > 0)
   - `Uploading journal: [JournalName] to [path]`
   - `✓ Journal uploaded successfully: [JournalName]`

### 4. Expected Behavior After Fix
- Directories are created ✓ (already working)
- Journal files are uploaded to `/journals/[id].json`
- Entry files are uploaded to `/entries/[year]/[month]/[entry-id].json`
- Attachment files are uploaded to `/attachments/[path]`

## Technical Details

### Root Cause
The `SyncConfig.syncedJournalIds` list was empty by default when creating WebDAV configurations. This is intentional for security - users must explicitly choose which journals to sync.

### Code Changes Made
The WebDAV sync service has been fixed to:
1. ✅ Use correct file paths with `.json` extensions for journals
2. ✅ Use proper date-based organization for entries
3. ✅ Handle attachment paths correctly
4. ✅ Add comprehensive debug logging
5. ✅ Fix database method calls

## Content-Type Warning
The warning about "cannot be used to imply a default content-type" is harmless - it's just the WebDAV client being verbose. The actual uploads will work fine.
